 Hi, I’m @Aliscial. I happen to love the design aspect of Front End Development. I admire the logistics of FrontEnd: starting from the bottom and curating something  functional and operatable at "the top." With Promineo Tech I have apprenticed: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React Router. These Web programs have inspired me to continue building my ecommerce website. I have a retail business called C.O.I.L or "Covering Others In Love, (designed to promote positivity)." I'm now more informed on how to build a profitable site.
 I want my websites to be easily maneuvered through and asethetically pleasing to the eye. With the help of Promineo I will be able to accomplish my business ventures or projects. I look forward to working with other Front End enthusiast and bringing life to future endeavors! For more information you can reach me via LinkedIn or Facebook. Thanks for stopping by!
